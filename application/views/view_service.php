                  <h2>Why does this service exist?</h2>
                  <p>Over 2 Million children under the age of 5 die every year ,<br>in India* and another 1 Million or more are disabled for life.<br> A major cause is that parents often forget to vaccinate <br>the child on time.

                The IAP Immunizeindia mobile application is available<br> as a free of cost download from the <br>
                Google PlayStore and the Apple AppStore.<br>
                Parents receive timely vaccination reminders for their<br> children as pop up notifications and 
                also by email
                </p>

               <h2>Why now?</h2>
               <p>Vaccination reminder services in several countries have been<br> effective in increasing compliance by 20%.
                There are<br> over 40 published scientific studies in the Cochrane <br>database that prove the effectiveness of <br>vaccination reminders.

                India has 800 million mobile phones which support<br> Text Message Service or SMS (every family has a phone). 
                A well promoted, <br>national, text message reminder service will be the the<br> most cost effective method 
                of reminding parents that a vaccination is due.</p>
